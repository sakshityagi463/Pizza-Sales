## Problem Statement:

Our goal is to analyze key indicators for our pizza sales data to gain insights into our business performance. Specifically, we want to calculate the following metrics:

1. Total Revenue
2. Average Order Value
3. Total Pizzas Sold
4. Total Orders
5. Average Pizzas Per Order

## Software Used:

- SQL
- Power BI

## Raw Data:

Our dataset contains detailed information about pizza orders, including order ID, date, pizza size, category, quantity, and revenue.

## Import Data in SQL:

We imported our raw data into SQL for efficient data management and querying.

## SQL Queries for KPIs:

We crafted SQL queries to calculate the key performance indicators (KPIs) required for our analysis.

## SQL Queries for Daily and Monthly Trend:

We developed SQL queries to analyze daily and monthly trends in pizza sales, enabling us to identify patterns and variations over time.

## SQL Queries for Percentage of Sales by Category & Size:

Using SQL, we determined the percentage of total sales contributed by each pizza category and size.

## SQL Queries for Top 5 & Bottom 5:

We utilized SQL to identify the top 5 and bottom 5 performing pizza items based on revenue.

## Power BI Intro:

Power BI was introduced as our tool for creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards.

## Connecting Power BI to SQL DB:

We established a connection between Power BI and our SQL database to import and manipulate the data.

## Data Cleaning using Power Query:

We performed data cleaning and transformation tasks using Power Query within Power BI to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our analysis.

## Building KPIs:

We calculated the KPIs, including total revenue, average order value, total pizzas sold, total orders, and average pizzas per order, within Power BI.

## Data Processing in Power BI:

We processed the data within Power BI to create meaningful visualizations and derive actionable insights.

## Building Daily and Monthly Trend Charts:

Using Power BI, we built interactive charts to visualize the daily and monthly trends in pizza sales.

## Building Percentage of Sales by Category & Size:

We created visualizations in Power BI to showcase the percentage contribution of each pizza category and size to total sales.

## Adding Insights:

Insights were added to our dashboard to provide context and interpretation of the data, aiding decision-making.

## Worst and Best Sellers Dashboard:

We designed a dashboard highlighting the worst and best performing pizza items based on revenue.

## Adding Navigator Buttons:

Navigator buttons were added to enhance user experience, allowing easy navigation between different sections of the dashboard.
